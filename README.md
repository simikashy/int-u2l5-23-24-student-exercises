### Introduction to Stylesheets
#### Internal CSS
- Include CSS directly in HTML document using the `<style>` tag.
- Example:
```html
<head>
  <style>
    /* CSS here */
  </style>
</head>
```

#### External CSS
- Link an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` tag.
- External CSS allows styling across multiple pages.
- Example:
```html
<head>
  <title>My Awesome Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

### Introduction to Documentation
#### What is Documentation?
- Written material that helps in understanding, using, and debugging the code.
- Essential for collaboration among coders.

#### Code Nation Coding Guides
- A resource to look up syntax and examples of HTML tags and CSS properties.

#### W3Schools
- A website for learning coding online, great for examples and trying out code.

#### Bootstrap
- A CSS framework that simplifies styling.
- Use the `<link>` tag to import Bootstrap.

## Key Takeaways
- **Stylesheets** can be used internally or externally. External linking allows for more flexibility across multiple pages.
- **Documentation** is a crucial part of software development, allowing you to understand and utilize code effectively.
- **Resources** like W3Schools, Code Nation Coding Guides, and Bootstrap can significantly aid in learning and development.

Happy coding! :)
